## 🚀 What I Built

1. **KPI Cards**  
   - Total Sales (new measure)  
   - Total Orders (distinct count of "Order_ID")  

2. **Trend Line: Sales Over Time**  
   - Interactive drill-down (Year → Quarter → Month)  

3. **Clustered Column: Sales by Region & Category**  
   - Clean split by Region on the X-axis  
   - Category legend for deeper insight  

4. **Pie Chart: Ship Mode Distribution**  
   - Counts of orders by "Ship_Mode" 

5. **Slicers**  
   - Filter everything by **Region** and **Segment** at once
